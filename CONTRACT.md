# `/analyze` Response Contract

**Owner:** AI Engine (@Zuil909) · **Consumers:** `web/index.html` · **Version:** `0.17` (shipped)

> **Recent changes**
>
> - **`0.17` — `placement.y` moves to the bottom of the frame (behavioural).** The band was
>   `0.62 / 0.667 / 0.70` and is now `0.84 / 0.88 / 0.90`. `y` is where a standing subject's FEET
>   go, so the old values asked for someone two thirds up the picture with the bottom third left
>   as bare ground — and a client comparing a tracked ankle against it told anyone standing at a
>   natural distance to keep walking backwards. Same shape as before: lower when the top of the
>   frame is busy, higher when there is foreground to stand clear of. The `y` clamp is now a real
>   guard (`0.80`–`0.94`) rather than dead code. **Consumers drawing a figure up from this point
>   must grow it** — a body box sized for the old band describes someone from the chest down.
>
> - **`0.16` — `placement` and the standing marker are back (breaking; reverses `0.15`).** The
>   in-frame marker and its live subject tracking return, so `placement` (`{x, y, reason,
>   reason_text}`) is a field again with `_compute_placement` behind it. `placement_hint` returns to
>   its `0.13` role — **depth only**, refining a marker that already shows left/right — and the
>   model is told once more which side the geometry picked, so the two cannot contradict each other.
>   **Consequence for consumers:** positioning no longer depends on the vision call. A degraded scan
>   still shows the marker and loses only the depth sentence that refines it, reversing the warning
>   `0.15` added to §3.8. The backlight veto is geometric again rather than something the prompt
>   asks for.
>
>   **Kept from `0.15`'s prompt, deliberately:** never tell the subject which way to face; the spot
>   must be inside this frame and walkable; `left`/`right` mean the viewer's. Those fixed real
>   faults in the model's wording and had nothing to do with the marker's absence.
>
> - **`0.15` — the standing marker and `placement` were removed (reversed by `0.16`).** For one
>   release the app's entire positioning guidance was `placement_hint` alone. Kept in this list
>   because a consumer pinned to `0.15` sees no `placement` field at all; anything reading this
>   contract at `0.16` or later can treat it as history.
>
> - **`0.14` — request field `lang` (additive, optional).** `POST /analyze` accepts a `lang` form
>   field of `en` (default) or `zh`. It decides the language of the three model-written fields —
>   `scene_type`, `hashtags`, `placement_hint` — which previously drifted between English and
>   Chinese within a single response. A request without it, or with a value the engine does not
>   know, behaves exactly as before. **Not affected:** `filter` is always an English keyword, and
>   `placement.reason_text` / `camera_tilt.reason` stay English — both carry a stable machine key
>   (`placement.reason`, `camera_tilt.direction`) that the client translates itself, so no paid
>   call is spent on a sentence the client already knows. See §3.6.
>
> - **`0.13` — `placement_hint` (additive).** One short model-written instruction saying where to
>   stand, anchored to something visible and expressing **depth** — the thing a flat marker cannot
>   show. The model is told which side the geometry chose, so its wording cannot contradict the
>   marker. Free text, so it is validated server-side: anything unusable becomes `""`. See §3.8.
>
> - **`0.12` — the engine now explains itself (additive).** `placement` gains `reason` (closed
>   enum) and `reason_text` (short display string) naming the signal that actually decided the
>   side, and a new top-level `camera_tilt` reports dead space in the frame. Purely additive:
>   existing consumers reading `placement.x` / `.y` are unaffected. See §3.1 and §3.7.
>
> - **`0.11` — a failing vision call no longer `500`s the scan.** Previously an OpenAI timeout,
>   rate limit, auth failure or outage propagated and became a `500`, discarding OpenCV work that
>   had already succeeded. It now degrades exactly like a bad completion: `200` with
>   `scene_type: "Unknown"`, `hashtags: []`, `filter: "Vivid"`, and the whole measured half
>   (`placement`, `composition`, `lighting`, `blurry`) fully intact. **Consumers that treated a
>   `200` as proof the model ran must stop doing so** — check `scene_type != "Unknown"` instead.
>   Non-object JSON from the model degrades the same way rather than raising. Both are logged
>   server-side under the `daka.engine` logger.
>
> - **`0.10` — `pose_tips` removed (breaking).** The product thesis narrowed: subject positioning,
>   framing and basic colour grading are what make the photo, and the subject poses how they want
>   to. The field is gone from both the vision prompt and the response, which also removes the only
>   part of the model output nobody consumed. **Exception to the additive rule below**, taken
>   knowingly: the sole consumer never read the field, so nothing breaks. Anyone who *was* reading
>   it should treat a missing key as `[]`.
> - **`0.10` — `lighting.tone` inversion fixed.** Values recorded before this are inverted. See §3.2.

This document describes the JSON that `POST /analyze` **actually returns today**, as implemented in
[`scene_analysis.py`](scene_analysis.py) and served by [`api_server.py`](api_server.py). Section 6
records the larger `framing` design that was drafted but is **not implemented** — it is kept as a
proposal, not a promise.

> **History.** Earlier revisions of this file specified a `1.0` shape (`framing`, `objects`,
> `framing_suggestions`, `scene_yap`, `contract_version`, `coord_space`) that the engine never
> emitted, while omitting fields it does emit (`placement`, `blurry`, `blur_var`,
> `edge_sharpness`). It has been rewritten to match reality. The version stays below `1.0` to make
> clear that the `1.0` name is still unclaimed.

> **Golden rule — every change is additive.** Never rename, remove, or change the type of an
> existing field. New fields default to `[]`, `""`, or `null` so an older client keeps working.
> A breaking change needs a version bump and a heads-up to the team.

## 1. The one coordinate convention (read this first)

Every position in this contract uses **one** convention:

```
normalized [0, 1]   origin = TOP-LEFT of the frame   x → right   y → DOWN
```

- To draw on screen: `px = x * videoClientWidth`, `py = y * videoClientHeight`.
- This matches the CSS grid in [`web/index.html`](web/index.html) (`top: 33.33% / 66.66%`,
  `left: 33.33% / 66.66%`), so the four rule-of-thirds intersections are
  `x ∈ {0.333, 0.667} × y ∈ {0.333, 0.667}`.
- Coordinates are **resolution-independent**: the scan frame (capped at 1024px) and the keeper
  frame (capped at 2560px) share the same field of view, so the same normalized point lands
  correctly on both.

Note that the response does **not** currently carry a `coord_space` marker — see §5.

## 3. Field reference

### 3.1 `placement` — where the subject should stand *(drives the standing marker)*

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `x` | number | **snapped to a rule-of-thirds line: `0.333` or `0.667`** |
| `y` | number | where the subject's **feet** go: one of `0.84`, `0.88`, `0.90` — adapts to where saliency mass sits vertically. Clamped to `0.80`–`0.94` |
| `reason` | enum | which signal decided the side — closed set below |
| `reason_text` | string | short display string for `reason`, ≤ 34 chars, safe to show verbatim |

Closed `reason` set — the client may switch on these, and must fall back to showing `reason_text`
for anything unrecognised:

```
backlight   light   balance   clean_background   default
```

`reason` names a signal that voted **the way the marker actually went**. A signal that argued the
other way and lost is never credited, because explaining the marker with the one argument against
its position would be worse than saying nothing. `backlight` always wins when the veto fires, since
it is a hard constraint rather than a vote. `default` means the tie-break decided and no signal can
honestly be credited.

Computed by [`_compute_placement`](scene_analysis.py#L56-L154), which fuses three gated signals —
visual **balance** (stand opposite the scene's focal mass), background **cleanliness** (prefer the
side whose body-band is emptier), and **light direction** (stand on the dimmer side so light falls
on the face) — plus a hard **backlight veto** so the subject is never placed in front of a
blown-out region. Never raises; falls back to `{0.667, 0.88}`.

> ⚠️ **This is a composition target, not a point to aim the camera at.** `x` is already snapped to
> a thirds line for the framing that was scanned. Panning the camera until this point reaches
> screen-centre would drag the subject to dead-centre and discard the placement the engine solved
> for. Draw it as a fixed in-frame marker. (This exact confusion was a live bug; see the
> `standPos` / `aim` comment block in `index.html`.)

### 3.2 `lighting` — *(gates capture)*

| Field | Type | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `quality` | enum | `Good` (brightness 100–200) · `Fair` (60–100 or 200–230) · `Poor` (otherwise) |
| `tone` | enum | `Warm` (`color_ratio` < 0.7) · `Cool` (> 0.9) · `Neutral` (between) |
| `tip` | string | one of nine fixed strings, keyed by `(quality, tone)` |

**`quality == "Poor"` blocks the flow** — the client shows the capture gate and forces a rescan.

`color_ratio` is an internal feature, not part of this response. It is
`avg_color[0] / avg_color[2]` over an image `cv2.imread` loads as **BGR**, so it is
**blue ÷ red** — a *higher* ratio means *more blue*, i.e. a **cooler** scene. The neutral band sits
near 0.8 rather than 1.0 because most scenes carry a mild red bias.

> **Behaviour change (`tone` inversion fixed).** `assess_lighting` previously mapped the *high*
> (blue-dominant) end of `color_ratio` to `"Warm"`, so `tone` — and therefore the `tip` string —
> came out backwards: a golden-hour café was told "Nice cool tones, use them for a clean
> aesthetic". The two comparisons have been swapped; thresholds are unchanged, so the neutral band
> stays where it was calibrated and `quality` is unaffected. The nine `tip` strings were already
> written for the correct semantics and now route correctly. `filter` was never affected — the
> model picks that independently. **Any `tone` value recorded before this fix is inverted.**

### 3.3 `blurry`, `blur_var`, `edge_sharpness` — *(gates capture)*

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `blurry` | bool | **`true` blocks the flow** and forces a rescan |
| `blur_var` | number | variance of Laplacian, 1 d.p. — diagnostic only |
| `edge_sharpness` | number | mean \|Laplacian\| at Canny edges, 2 d.p.; `-1.0` means "too plain to judge" |

The gate is deliberately **content-robust**: variance-of-Laplacian alone flags any low-texture
scene (plain wall, minimalist café) as blurry, which blocked the whole flow. Instead the engine
judges the sharpness of the edges that actually exist, and gives a near-featureless frame the
benefit of the doubt. Thresholds are lenient — over-rejecting is the worse failure — and tunable
against `blur_var` / `edge_sharpness` from real photos. See
[`scene_analysis.py:29-37`](scene_analysis.py#L29-L37).

### 3.7 `camera_tilt` — aim off the dead third *(drives the tilt cue)*

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `direction` | enum | `"up"` \| `"down"` \| `"ok"` — which way to aim the camera |
| `reason` | string | short display string; **empty when `direction` is `"ok"`** |

`"down"` means aim **lower**, because the dead space is *above* — blank ceiling or featureless sky
eating the top of the frame. Computed by comparing the visual interest in the top, middle and
bottom thirds of the saliency map placement already builds, so it costs one extra pass over an
array in memory and no extra tokens.

Deliberately conservative: a band must carry under **45%** of the rest of the frame's interest
*and* be emptier than the opposite band, and the whole check is skipped on a flat, low-contrast
map. Otherwise the cue fires on ordinary scenes and gets ignored.

### 3.8 `placement_hint` — where to stand, in words *(shown above the shutter)*

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `placement_hint` | string | ≤ 60 chars, no trailing full stop; **`""` when unusable** |

`placement` and the marker give the position **across** the frame. Neither can express how far
**into** the scene to stand, and the geometry has no idea there is a doorway or a bench to stand in
front of — only the model sees that. So this is asked for in the same vision call, phrased around
depth (*"in front of"*, *"just behind"*, *"level with"*), and the model is told which side the
engine picked so its sentence cannot contradict the marker.

**What the prompt constrains**, because a hint can be well-formed and still useless:

| Constraint | Why |
|---|---|
| Never says which way to face | The subject is being photographed, so they face the lens. Real scans came back asking people to face a window, or away from the camera. |
| The spot must be in this frame and walkable | The model sees one image and does not otherwise know it is the shot itself, so it would pick spots behind the camera, out of frame, or on a road. |
| `left` / `right` mean as seen in the photo | Otherwise it silently alternates between the viewer's left and the subject's. |

Front and side light are **not** in that list: since `0.16` the backlight veto in
`_compute_placement` (§3.1) guarantees it geometrically, so asking the model for it as well would
be a weaker duplicate of a constraint already enforced.

It is the only free-text field here that is not drawn from a closed set, so it is **validated, not
trusted**: wrong type, empty, whitespace-only or over 60 characters all collapse to `""`, and the
client then renders nothing. A sentence that overflows the panel is worse than no sentence. Note
that the constraints above are *asked for*, not enforced — nothing server-side can tell whether a
returned sentence honours them.

It is also `""` whenever the model call degrades — see §3.6. Since `0.16` that is no longer fatal
to positioning: `placement` (§3.1) is pure OpenCV and survives a failed vision call, so a degraded
scan still shows the marker and loses only the depth sentence that refines it.

### 3.4 `composition` — descriptive assessment

| Field | Type | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `focus` | enum | `Sharp` · `Soft` · `Blurry` (from Canny edge density) |
| `horizon` | enum | `Level` · `Slightly tilted` · `Tilted` (from Hough-line deviation) |
| `balance` | enum | `Balanced` · `Slightly off` · `Unbalanced` (from left/right saliency split) |

Derived from measured features, not from the model — reliable. Currently **unused by the UI**.

### 3.5 `blueprint` — orientation + advisory notes

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `orientation` | enum | `portrait` (h ≥ w) · `landscape` |
| `grid` | const | always `"rule_of_thirds"` |
| `notes` | string[] | 0–3 of: tilted horizon · unbalanced composition · strong rule-of-thirds alignment |

Currently **unused by the UI**.

### 3.6 `scene_type`, `hashtags`, `filter` — the model's output

**Language** *(new in `0.14`)*: `scene_type`, `hashtags` and `placement_hint` are written in the
language named by the request's `lang` field — `en` (default) or `zh` — and the prompt requires all
of them to agree. `filter` is not translated in any language: it is matched against `VALID_FILTERS`
server-side and looked up in `FILTER_CSS` by the client, so it is a key, not prose.

All three come from a single vision call in `_analyze_with_gpt`, which **never raises**. Every
failure mode yields `{}` and each field falls back to its default rather than failing the scan:

- a truncated, empty, refused or unparseable completion
- valid JSON that is not an object (an array, string, number or `null`)
- an **API-level failure** — timeout, rate limit, auth failure, outage *(new in `0.11`)*

This is deliberate rather than incidental. The measured half of the response — `placement`,
`composition`, `lighting`, `blueprint`, `blurry` — is computed by OpenCV before the vision call and
does not depend on the model at all, so an OpenAI incident costs the scene label and hashtags while
leaving positioning and framing fully intact.

> **The corollary for consumers:** a `200` is *not* proof the model ran. A response where
> `scene_type` is `"Unknown"`, `hashtags` is `[]` and `filter` is `"Vivid"` is indistinguishable
> from a degraded one — because that is exactly what a degraded one looks like. If you need to
> know, test `scene_type != "Unknown"`. Server-side, both failure classes are logged as warnings
> under the `daka.engine` logger.

| Field | Type | Fallback | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scene_type` | string | `"Unknown"` | concise name, e.g. `"Café"`, `"City Street"`, `"Temple"` |
| `hashtags` | string[] | `[]` | asked for exactly 3, lowercase, with `#` |
| `filter` | enum | `"Vivid"` | **server-validated** against the list below; anything else becomes `"Vivid"` |

Closed `filter` set — the client maps these 1:1 to CSS filter strings:

```
Vivid  Vivid Warm  Vivid Cool
Dramatic  Dramatic Warm  Dramatic Cool
Silvertone  Noir
```

`hashtags` counts are *requested*, not enforced — the engine passes the array through unchanged, so
treat its length defensively.

`max_completion_tokens` stays at 500 even though the ask shrank when `pose_tips` was dropped. On a
reasoning-capable model that budget also covers reasoning tokens, so trimming it risks empty
completions rather than saving latency — worth measuring against the real model before touching.

## 4. Errors

Every error body is `{"error": "<safe message>"}` — a single shape, and every message is safe to
show the user verbatim.

| Status | Message | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| `400` | `Image not suitable for analysis` | flagged by `omni-moderation-latest` |
| `400` | `That image couldn't be read — try scanning again.` | undecodable / truncated / mislabelled upload |
| `400` | `The upload was empty.` | zero-byte body |
| `413` | `That image is too large — it must be under 8 MB.` | exceeds `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` |
| `415` | `That file isn't a supported image — use a JPEG, PNG or WebP.` | `content_type` outside the allow-list |
| `429` | `Too many scans in a row — wait a moment, then scan again.` | over 20 requests / 60 s from one IP |
| `500` | `Analysis failed on the server — try again in a moment.` | anything else; detail is logged, never returned |

Since `0.11` a failing **vision** call is no longer in the `500` bucket — it degrades to a `200`
(see §3.6). A failing **moderation** call was already outside it, since moderation fails open. So
the remaining realistic causes of a `500` are OpenCV or PIL faults on a file that decoded but could
not be analysed.

Notes:

- **Exception ordering matters.** `InappropriateImageError` subclasses `ValueError`, so it must be
  caught first or a moderation rejection would be reported as an unreadable image.
- **The rate limit is cost control, not security.** Per-IP and in-memory, so it resets on every
  free-plan cold start, and the `X-Forwarded-For` it keys on is client-spoofable. It exists because
  each `/analyze` costs two OpenAI calls (moderation + vision). Needs a shared store if the service
  is ever scaled past one instance.
- **CORS is not access control.** `allow_origins` is pinned to the live frontend (override with the
  `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var, comma-separated, to add a preview deploy or `http://localhost:…` for
  local dev). It stops other *sites* from spending the key through a visitor's browser; it does
  nothing against a direct `curl`. There is still no authentication.
- **Moderation fails open.** If the moderation call itself errors,
  [`_moderate_image`](scene_analysis.py#L116-L125) returns "safe". Deliberate, but it is a bypass.

The client treats a missing `lighting` key as a bad response regardless of status, and surfaces
`data.error` as the toast text, so these messages reach the user as written.

`lighting` is therefore load-bearing for validity detection — don't remove it.

---

## 5. Consumer cheat-sheet — who reads what

| Field | Consumed by `index.html` | How |
|---|:---:|---|
| `lighting.quality` | ✅ | capture gate — `Poor` blocks |
| `blurry` | ✅ | capture gate — `true` blocks |
| `scene_type` | ✅ | badge on camera + results |
| `placement` | ✅ | fixed standing marker |
| `filter` | ✅ | preview + baked into the saved pixels |
| `hashtags` | ✅ | tappable pills, copy-all, share text |
| `lighting` (presence) | ✅ | response-validity check |
| `lighting.tip` | — | generated, not shown |
| `composition` | — | generated, not shown |
| `blueprint` | — | generated, not shown |
| `blur_var`, `edge_sharpness` | — | diagnostics, for tuning only |

**Client must-honour guarantees**

1. All coords are normalized, top-left origin, `[0,1]`.
2. `filter` comes only from the closed set in §3.6; unknown values must fall back, not throw.
3. `placement` is an in-frame composition target — render it fixed, never chase it with the camera.
4. `placement_hint` is free text from the model — render it verbatim, but treat `""` as "nothing to
   show", not an error.
5. Live device roll (the horizon level, and the straighten cue) is entirely client-owned, read from
   `devicemotion`. The engine reports **scene** tilt via `composition.horizon`. Don't merge the two
   into one indicator.

**Known gaps** (cheap, additive, worth doing)

- No `contract_version` field — clients cannot tell which engine build answered.
- No `coord_space: "normalized_topleft"` self-documenting marker.
- `lighting.tip` is computed on every scan and thrown away. It costs nothing (pure OpenCV, no
  tokens), so this is a UI gap rather than waste — unlike `pose_tips`, which did cost tokens and
  was removed in `0.10`.
- Under the current product thesis — positioning, framing and colour grading are what matter —
  `composition` and `blueprint` are the fields most worth surfacing next: `composition.horizon`
  and `blueprint.notes` speak directly to framing, and both are already computed.

## 6. Proposed, NOT implemented

Everything in this section is design work, not API surface. **Do not build against it.** It is
retained because the geometry is worked out and most of it is derivable from features the engine
already computes.

### 6.1 `framing` — bake the math server-side

The idea: the engine precomputes guidance so the client reads enums instead of doing geometry.

```jsonc
"framing": {
  "subject":  { "detected": true, "source": "saliency", "label": "salient_region",
                "confidence": 0.82, "center": {"x":0.52,"y":0.61},
                "bbox": null, "size": 0.70 },
  "target":   { "intersection": "bottom-left", "x": 0.333, "y": 0.667 },
  "guidance": { "move_subject_x": "left", "move_subject_y": "up", "distance": "closer",
                "dx": -0.187, "dy": -0.057, "strength": 0.31 },
  "level":    { "scene_horizon_tilt_deg": 3.4, "needs_straightening": true,
                "source_alignment": 0.71 },
  "reason":   "Stand at the left third by the window so soft light hits your face"
}
```

Feasibility from today's code:

| Sub-object | Status |
|---|---|
| `level` | **Easy** — `features["alignment"]` already exists; `needs_straightening` is `alignment < 0.7` |
| `target` | **Easy** — `placement` already is the nearest strong thirds point |
| `subject` | **Needs live tracking.** `/analyze` is one-shot on an *empty* scene, so there is no subject to detect. This only becomes meaningful with in-browser per-frame tracking |
| `guidance` | Depends on `subject` — it is `target − subject`, so it needs the above first |

> If `guidance` is ever built, settle the sign convention **first**: `move_subject_*` moves the
> subject in-frame; moving the *camera* is the opposite direction. Pick one and name it explicitly.

### 6.2 `objects[]` — raw detections

`[{ "label": "window", "box": {x,y,w,h}, "confidence": 0.88 }]`, ≤ 8 entries, advisory only. Would
let the client avoid placing the subject on top of furniture. Requires adding object detection to
the vision prompt and validating/clamping the boxes server-side.

### 6.3 `framing_suggestions[]` — semantic placement directives

Up to 3 ordered `{target, instruction, anchor}` directives about *placement* — of the subject or the
camera. This is the one proposal here that still fits the current product thesis, since it is
framing guidance rather than pose advice. The `anchor` was to be a closed set mapping 1:1 to UI
affordances:

```
left_third  right_third  center  upper_third  lower_third      ← subject grid cells
tilt_up  tilt_down  pan_left  pan_right                        ← camera rotation
step_back  step_closer  raise_camera  lower_camera  level_horizon  ← camera position / level
```

### 6.4 `scene_yap` — shareable one-liner

One on-brand sentence (≤ ~90 chars) for the share caption, alongside the hashtag pills. Open
question: English voice with `打卡` allowed inline, ≤ 1 emoji, no hashtags inside.

(The watermark this originally sat beside has since been removed — people want their photo, not

### 6.5 Out of scope

- **Lens awareness.** The 0.5× ultra-wide toggle is a client-side capture concern; `/analyze` is
  not lens-aware and has no `lens` request field. Revisit only if ultra-wide distortion is found
  to skew placement advice.
- **Real-time tracking in the engine.** `/analyze` is one-shot per scan. Any live tracking is
  client-owned polish layered on top of `placement`, not an engine dependency.
