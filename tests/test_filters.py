"""The colour grades, measured rather than eyeballed.

Warm and cool are a white-balance change: red up and blue down, or the reverse. CSS filter
functions cannot express one — `hue-rotate` leaves a neutral completely untouched, because grey has
no hue to rotate, and `sepia` only ever goes warm while desaturating as it goes. The grades used
both, so the cool ones tinted nothing at all and 'Vivid Warm' came out *less* warm than 'Vivid'.

The tint is now a channel gain, applied by an SVG colour matrix in the preview and by `tint()` when
baking the saved file. These tests run the page's own baking maths over real colours, so the
numbers here are exactly what a saved photo gets.
