"""Runtime checks on the viewfinder overlay drawing code.

The client had no tests at all, and that let a real bug ship: a refactor changed
`drawStandMarker(tf, ctx, ...)` to `drawStandMarker(W, H, ctx, ...)` but left one `tf.H` behind in
the caption's font line. `tf` was no longer in scope, so the function threw a ReferenceError on
every frame — after drawing the marker but before drawing its caption. The exception escaped the
whole coaching block, so `setCue()` never ran and every cue froze on the placeholder text baked
into the HTML. Silently, and only on a device.

`node --check` cannot catch that: it is valid syntax. Only *running* the function does. These
tests extract the real function from the shipped page and execute it against a stub canvas, so an
out-of-scope identifier fails here instead of on someone's phone.
