"""Runs the real render loop against a stubbed DOM.

Two bugs shipped to a phone in consecutive PRs, both the same shape: an identifier that was not in
scope, inside the overlay code. `tf.H` after a signature change, then `ts` after adding subject
detection to a loop that takes no timestamp parameter. Both are valid JavaScript, so `node --check`
passed and CI was green. Both only failed when the function actually ran.

`test_client_overlay.py` executes individual drawing functions. This file executes the *loop* —
the thing that decides whether anything gets drawn at all — because that is where both bugs lived
and neither would have been caught by testing the drawing functions alone.

The stub is deliberately dumb: it records calls and returns plausible values. It is not a browser
and cannot tell you the marker looks right. What it can tell you is that a frame completes without
throwing, and that the marker and cue are actually reached — which is exactly what was broken.
