"""Tests for _compute_placement — where the app tells the subject to stand.

This is the product's core output: it drives the standing marker, and it is ~70 lines of tuned
heuristics whose claims are all *directional* ("stand opposite the focal mass", "stand on the
dimmer side", "never stand in front of a blowout"). A sign error in any of them would look
entirely plausible while giving exactly backwards advice — which is what happened to
assess_lighting's tone mapping. These tests pin each direction down independently.
